        #    a well established parent. If the widget already
        #    exists, don't create it again, just retrieve its
        #    handle.
        #
        # 2. Now dock our QT control in a new panel tab of
        #    Maya Channel Box dock area. We use the
        #    Qt object name property to do the bind.
        #
        # 3. Lastly, since our widgets won't get notified about
        #    when the parent dock is closed (and sometimes when it
        #    needs redrawing), attach some QT event watchers to it
        #
        # Note: It is possible that the close event and some of the
        #       refresh doesn't propagate down to the widget because
        #       of a misaligned parenting: The tk widget exists inside
        #       the pane layout but is still parented to the main
        #       Maya window. It's possible that by setting up the parenting
        #       explicitly, the missing signals we have to compensate for
        #       may start to work. I tried a bunch of stuff but couldn't get
