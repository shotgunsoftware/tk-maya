        # The general approach below is as follows:
        #
        # 1. First create our qt tk app widget using QT.
        #    parent it to the maya main window to give it
        #    a well established parent. If the widget already
        #    exists, don't create it again, just retrieve its
        #    handle
        #
        # 2. Now create a native maya window and layout and
        #    attach our QT control to this. For this, we use
        #    the QT objectname property to do the bind. Note that
        #    the window won't show in the UI, this is all just
        #    setting up the hiearchy.
        #
        # 3. If a panel already exists, delete it. The panel
        #    no longer has the tk widget inside it, since that is
        #    parented to the window that was just created
        #
        # 4. Create a new panel using the dockControl command and
        #    pass our maya window in as the object to dock.
        #
        # 5. Lastly, since our widgets won't get notified about
        #    when the parent dock is closed (and sometimes when it
        #    needs redrawing), attach some QT event watchers to it
        #
        #
        # Note: It is possible that the close event and some of the
        #       refresh doesn't propagate down to the widget because
        #       of a misaligned parenting: The tk widget exists inside
        #       the pane layout but is still parented to the main
        #       maya window. It's possible that by setting up the parenting
        #       explicitly, the missing signals we have to compensate for
        #       may start to work. I tried a bunch of stuff but couldn't get
        #       it to work and instead resorted to the event watcher setup.
