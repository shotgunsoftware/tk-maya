Build instructions for Pyside, QT and Python - on Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------

This version of pyside was built with python 2.6 (64 bit) and QT 4.7.1 to match Maya 2012/2013.
These instructions assume a clean centos 6 linux build.


INSTALL GCC 4.1.2
=================

We need to match up pyside against Maya, which means going through a number of steps.
First, we need to make sure we compile everything using the right version of GCC.

Install some stuff first:
> sudo yum install glibc-devel.i686
> sudo yum install texinfo

Now go through the steps in this document:
See http://docs.autodesk.com/MAYAUL/2013/ENU/Maya-API-Documentation/index.html

To summarize the doc above, you need to run configure with the following arguments:
../gcc-4.1.2/configure --prefix=/opt/gcc412 --program-suffix=412 --enable-shared 
--enable-threads=posix  --enable-checking=release --with-system-zlib 
--disable-libunwind-exceptions --enable-__cxa_atexit

And then run the boostrap:
make -j4 bootstrap

(finally run make install and create symlinks to /usr/bin)

NOTE!

You may get this error:
WARNING: `makeinfo' is missing on your system. You should only need it if
you modified a `.texi' or `.texinfo' file, or any other file
indirectly affecting the aspect of the manual. The spurious
call might also be the consequence of using a buggy `make' (AIX,
DU, IRIX). You might want to install the `Texinfo' package or
the `GNU make' package. Grab either from any GNU archive site.
make[3]: *** [fastjar.info] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/kamcio/devkit/gcc-4.1.2/gcc-build/fastjar'
make[2]: *** [all] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/kamcio/devkit/gcc-4.1.2/gcc-build/fastjar'
make[1]: *** [all-fastjar] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/kamcio/devkit/gcc-4.1.2/gcc-build'
make: *** [all] Error 2

This is relating to doc generation and in order to get rid of it you can edit the makefile
to remove the step where it does this check.


BUILDING QT
===========

First make sure we have all the dependnecies for QT:
> sudo yum install qt-devel

Now download the QT 471 source tarball and unpack it. Before building, we need to tell
it to use our 412 compiler, so do a 

> export CC=gcc412
> export CXX=g++412

Turn off certain GCC extensions that our older version of the compiler doesn't support:

./configure -no-ssse3

Finally run make / make install


BUILDING PYSIDE
===============

- install dependnecies
> sudo yum install cmake libxml2-devel libxslt-devel python-devel rpmdevtools gcc gcc-c++ make

- make sure that our newly built version of QT is used:
> export PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.7.1/bin:$PATH
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.7.1/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

- download the pyside helpers from git:
git clone git://gitorious.org/pyside/buildscripts.git pyside_sources

- Now move inside the new pyside-sources folder and clone all the PySide sub-projects:
cd pyside_sources
git clone git://gitorious.org/pyside/apiextractor.git
git clone git://gitorious.org/pyside/generatorrunner.git
git clone git://gitorious.org/pyside/shiboken.git
git clone git://gitorious.org/pyside/pyside.git
git clone git://gitorious.org/pyside/pyside-tools.git

- if you want a specific tag of the code, check that out for each repo:
git checkout 1.1.2 to use tag 1.1.2 for pyside for example (use 'git tag' to list tags)

- Get some required libraries (these are not actually part of the final binary distro, just used by intermediate products)
> sudo yum install cmake libxml2

- Run the build_and_install helper script. Unless you have changed your environment.sh, this should build into ~/pkg/pyside-sandbox




TESTING THE BUILD
=================

- Add your sandbox location to the PYTHONPATH and the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/pkg/pyside-sandbox/lib
> export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/pkg/pyside-sandbox/lib64/python2.6/site-packages

- Run python
python2.6

from PySide import QtGui
app = QtGui.QApplication([])
wid = QtGui.QWidget()
wid.resize(250, 150)
wid.setWindowTitle('Simple')
wid.show()
app.exec_()

- Hopefully this should give you a nice window popping up.



HOOKING UP WITH MAYA
====================




TESTING IN MAYA
===============

Last step is to test in maya. This is simple. 

- Launch Maya
- Add the pythonpath to sys.path
- Run some QT code:
>>> from PySide import QtGui
>>> wid = QtGui.QWidget()
>>> wid.resize(250, 150)
>>> wid.setWindowTitle('Simple')
>>> wid.show()
